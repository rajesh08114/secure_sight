# SecureSight CCTV Monitoring Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](./public/images/camera*.jpeg)

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time incident monitoring with computer vision alerts
- Multi-camera view with timeline playback
- Threat classification (5+ detection types)
- Optimistic UI for incident resolution
- Responsive dashboard (desktop/tablet ready)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Decisions
| Technology | Choice | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) | Optimal SSR, API routes, and React 18 features |
| Database | SQLite (Prisma) | Simple setup for local development, easy file-based storage |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe database client with intuitive migrations |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Rapid UI development with responsive utilities |
| Deployment | Vercel | Native Next.js support with seamless CI/CD |

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Create new project at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add environment variable:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   ```
4. Enable "Override build command":
   ```bash
   prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && next build
   ```


## 📦 Installation & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-sight.git
cd secure-sight
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma db seed
npm run dev
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
**Database Issues?**
```bash
# Reset completely
npx prisma migrate reset --force
rm -rf prisma/migrations
```

**Windows Permissions**
```powershell
icacls prisma\dev.db /grant "Everyone:F"
```
